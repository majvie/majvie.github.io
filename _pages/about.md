Hi, I’m Maximilian Vieweg. I’m a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, in the department of Engineering and Public Policy focusing on AI policy as it relates to fair competition.

I am currently a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and the Institute Técnico de Lisboa through the CMU Portugal program, where I am advised by João Paulo Costeira, Joana Mendonça, and Jon Peha. My current research focuses on using methods from natural language processing in the support of the enforcement of consumer protection and antitrust law. Before that, I studied [Marine and Maritime Robotics](https://www.master-mir.eu/) in Lisbon, Portugal and Toulon, France, where I had the chance to do fieldwork on [Svalbard](https://www.unis.no/courses/at-334-arctic-marine-measurements-techniques-operations-and-transport/), as well as on the [Azores](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mit-portugal-program_%F0%9D%90%87%F0%9D%90%A8%F0%9D%90%B0-%F0%9D%90%B0%F0%9D%90%9A%F0%9D%90%AC-%F0%9D%90%AD%F0%9D%90%A1%F0%9D%90%9E-%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%B1%F0%9D%90%A9%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%AB%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%A7%F0%9D%90%9C%F0%9D%90%9E-activity-7298306420188352512-KQmD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABn5l6gBBsYnbCm-eG7tAlQnY0O8MNbXXdo). During my undergrad I created the individual study program Mechanical Engineering --- Mechatronics at the Technical University of Vienna, where I mainly focused on controls engineering. 

In my free time I enjoy bouldering and cycling. Reach out if you have any questions!
