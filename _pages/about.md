Hi, I'm Max! I'm a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and the Instituto Técnico de Lisboa through the [CMU Portugal program](https://cmuportugal.org/), advised by João Paulo Costeira, Joana Mendonça, and Jon Peha. My research uses natural language processing to support the enforcement of consumer protection and antitrust law.


Before that, I studied [Marine and Maritime Robotics](https://www.master-mir.eu/) in Lisbon, Portugal and Toulon, France, where I had the opportunity to do fieldwork on [Svalbard](https://www.unis.no/courses/at-334-arctic-marine-measurements-techniques-operations-and-transport/), as well as on the [Azores](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mit-portugal-program_%F0%9D%90%87%F0%9D%90%A8%F0%9D%90%B0-%F0%9D%90%B0%F0%9D%90%9A%F0%9D%90%AC-%F0%9D%90%AD%F0%9D%90%A1%F0%9D%90%9E-%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%B1%F0%9D%90%A9%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%AB%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%A7%F0%9D%90%9C%F0%9D%90%9E-activity-7298306420188352512-KQmD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABn5l6gBBsYnbCm-eG7tAlQnY0O8MNbXXdo). During my undergrad I helped create the individual study program [Mechanical Engineering --- Mechatronics](https://www.tuwien.at/en/mwbw/study-programmes/mechanical-engineering) at the Technical University of Vienna, where I mainly focused on machine design and controls engineering. 


Outside of research, I boulder, cycle, and chip away at learning Portuguese. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
