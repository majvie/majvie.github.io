`drifter_simulation` - A simulation of drifter advection is created for the Toulon Bay. Its result is then compared to the movement of drifters set out at sea during a mission with Ifremer. Even during the time-span of five hours, the current velocities, sampled once per hour, could be used to predict drifter movement.
