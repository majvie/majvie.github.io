`object_detection` - A Faster R-CNN is trained to detect and categorize maritime objects, such as sailboats and buoys, at sea. Each detection is visualised with a bounding box and relevant metrics are displayed next to the image category. For this purpose images are filtered from the Pascal VOC for training.
