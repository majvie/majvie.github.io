`fish_classification` - This project involves using CNNs and PyTorch to classify fish images into different categories. We will train a model on a dataset of fish images and use it to predict the class of new, unseen images. Finally its performance is compared to a fine-tuned AlexNet and a MobileNet to explore Transfer Learning.
