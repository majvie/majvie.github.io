[`fish_classification`](https://github.com/majvie/fish_classification) - This project involves using CNNs and PyTorch to classify fish images into different categories. We will train a model on a dataset of fish images and use it to predict the class of new, unseen images. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying different fish species based on their images.
