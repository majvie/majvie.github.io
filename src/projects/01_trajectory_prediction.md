`trajectory_prediction` - For my bachelor thesis I implemented a method for tracking UAVs for cases of malfunctioning object trackers and object occlusion, comparing the performance of Kalman and Particle Filter based approaches. I achieved a significant improvement in robustness for occluded and noisy trackers.
