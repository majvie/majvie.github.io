`sonar_localisation` - A sonar transmitter is located in shallow waters, using the knowledge of the Green's function of the environment, taking into account reflections at the fluid interfaces. Assuming a stable environment the signals recorded by an  array of receivers is setn back to the source, creating a peak at the source's original location.
