![Maritime Object Detection](/images/maritime_object_detection.png)

A Faster R-CNN was trained to detect and categorize maritime objects, such as sailboats and buoys, at sea. Each detection is visualised with a bounding box and relevant metrics are displayed next to the image category. Images were filtered from the Pascal VOC dataset for training.
