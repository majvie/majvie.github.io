![Drifter Movement Simulation](/images/drifter_movement_simulation.png)

A simulation of drifter advection was created for the Toulon Bay region. The results were compared to the movement of drifters set out at sea during a mission with Ifremer. Even during a time-span of five hours, the current velocities sampled once per hour could be used to accurately predict drifter movement.
