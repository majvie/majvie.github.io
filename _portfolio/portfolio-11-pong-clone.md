![Pong Clone](/images/pong_clone.png)

I built a pong clone running on an STM32 microcontroller using a Nokia 5510 display and tilt sensors for controls. The microcontroller software architecture is built on interrupts, thereby optimizing energy consumption. The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/majvie/pong).
