Design, calculations, and dimensioning of a transmission box, clutches, and roll for roll forming according to DIN and ISO standards. As the team leader, I was responsible for the calculations and design of parts of the transmission as well as the hydraulically actuated multi-plate clutch, along with project management. The project documentation is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/majvie/transmission_box).
