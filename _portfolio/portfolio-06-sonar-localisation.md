![Sonar Localisation](/images/sonar_localisation.png)

A sonar transmitter was located in shallow waters using knowledge of the Green's function of the environment, accounting for reflections at fluid interfaces. Assuming a stable environment, the signals recorded by an array of receivers were sent back to the source, creating a peak at the source's original location.
