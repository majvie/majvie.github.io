![Trajectory Prediction](/images/trajectory_prediction.png)

For my bachelor thesis at TU Vienna, I implemented a method for tracking UAVs for cases of malfunctioning object trackers and object occlusion. The project compared the performance of Kalman Filter and Particle Filter based approaches, achieving a significant improvement in robustness for occluded and noisy trackers. The implementation is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/majvie/transmission_box).
