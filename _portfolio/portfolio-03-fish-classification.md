![Fish Classification](/images/fish_classification.png)

This project involves using CNNs and PyTorch to classify fish images into different categories. I trained a model on a dataset of fish images and used it to predict the class of new, unseen images. The model's performance was compared to a fine-tuned AlexNet and a MobileNet to explore Transfer Learning approaches. You can find the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/majvie/fish_categorisation).
